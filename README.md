# PlantOntogenyDynamics README
Collection of code and scripts for modeling project studying consumer-resource dynamics with explicit plant ontogeny from Simon et al, 2022 publication.

## Code Types:

* Mathematica .cdf files can be run for free using Wolfram’s Computable Document Format (cdf) file format with Wolfram’s free cdf player, available at: https://www.wolfram.com/cdf/
* R Markdown’s HTML files can opened and viewed with any standard internet browser.
* R scripts can be opened and run in either base R or RStudio.
* The RShiny app describing the random forest analysis we completed is active online and can be accessed via any internet browser by clicking the following link: https://prglaum.shinyapps.io/simData-randomForestRMD/ 

## Major Folders:
### COMPADRE:
Folder containing .R script and R Markdown html file describing process used to download plant matrix demographic data from the COMPADRE online database. 

### Simulation Data: 
Folder containing example simulation data made publicly available for use in the R Shiny random forest demonstration app available at https://prglaum.shinyapps.io/simData-randomForestRMD/. 
We only provide a selected subset of our full data given its large size. For the full simulation data set, please visit … 

### Simulation Analysis:
Folder containing Model Mathematica code (.cdf) and .R scripts of analysis used in used Sophia et al 2022, .R scripts required to load data for analysis in R, R markdown file of static random forest example, and R markdown/R Shiny code used to run the random forest demonstration app available at https://prglaum.shinyapps.io/simData-randomForestRMD/.
